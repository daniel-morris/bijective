Bijective is a class that can compute an exact pairing of strings and integers.
Every integer can be mapped to a string, and every string can be mapped back to an
integer, with no unpaired elements.

## Installation

Bijective can be installed using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), add the
following to the `require` section of your composer.json file and run
`composer install` or `php composer.phar install` depending on how you have installed
Composer.
